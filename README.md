# -Day-5-100---100DaysOfCode-Challenge

Today's challenge was all about finding the maximum and minimum elements in an array using the minimum number of comparisons. 🧮 This is an important algorithmic problem that focuses on optimizing performance.

💡 Challenge:
Given an array of size N, find the maximum and minimum elements using the fewest number of comparisons.

📝 Input/Output:
Input: arr[] = {3, 5, 4, 1, 9}
Output: Minimum element is: 1
Maximum element is: 9
Input: arr[] = {22, 14, 8, 17, 35, 3}
Output: Minimum element is: 3
Maximum element is: 35
